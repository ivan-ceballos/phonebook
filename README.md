# Phonebook Application

This project is part of [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) specifically covering all the exercises from Part 3 of the course.

## Description

The Phonebook Application is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to help users efficiently manage their personal contacts. It enables users to create, update, delete, and view contact details, including names and phone numbers. 

The backend handles data persistence using a **MongoDB** database and provides a REST API to interact with the data. The frontend, built with **React**, offers a user-friendly interface for managing contacts in real time. The project also implements input validation, error handling, and logging to ensure robust performance.
